# task-8

In this task,
I started by selecting a reputable free VPN service to ensure secure and private browsing. 
After researching several VPN providers, I selected one that offers strong encryption, a no-logs policy, and reliable servers.
I proceeded to sign up for the VPN service by providing the necessary registration details such as email and password, ensuring that I used a strong password for my account's security.

Once the registration was complete, I downloaded the VPN client software from the official website of the provider. 
After successful installation, I launched the VPN client and logged into my account. 
The interface provided various server locations to connect to; I selected a server closest to my physical location to achieve better connection speeds while maintaining anonymity.

After connecting to the VPN server, I verified whether my IP address had changed by visiting a site like whatismyipaddress.com.
This confirmed that my internet traffic was now being routed through the VPN server, effectively masking my original IP address.
To ensure that my data was being encrypted, I visited a few websites and monitored that the HTTPS encryption was active during browsing, indicating that my internet traffic was secure.

Next, I disconnected the VPN to observe the difference in browsing speed and compare the visible IP addresses before and after VPN usage. 
The browsing speed was slightly faster without the VPN, which is expected since VPN encryption adds some processing overhead.

Following the practical test, I researched more about how VPN encryption works and the privacy features they offer.
VPNs use encryption protocols such as OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IKEv2 to secure data transmission, preventing interception by hackers, ISPs, or government agencies.
They also help bypass geo-restrictions and access content that may be blocked in certain regions. However, VPNs have limitations too. 
Free VPN services may have data caps, limited server options, slower speeds, or may collect user data if not carefully chosen.
Furthermore, while VPNs enhance privacy, they cannot fully protect against malware, phishing, or tracking done through cookies and browser fingerprinting.

In conclusion, VPNs are a valuable tool for enhancing online privacy, securing data on public Wi-Fi networks, and accessing restricted content.
However, one must carefully select a trustworthy VPN provider and understand that VPNs are just one layer of online security.
